**Backyard** is the database API.

From **InHouse** you can make CRUD to the database.

**Facade** is the website for the final user and it gets the newest from the DB communicating again through the API(Backyard).

*Inhouse and Facade are not connected, the naming convention used is to give the components business meaning.*
